# conjure-bits

Bits and bobs to do with constraints programming (particularly conjure and
minion).

This is mostly examples and proof of concepts to do with my work on [Conjure
Oxide](https://github.com/conjure-cp/conjure-oxide) and the [Minion
solver](https://github.com/minion/minion) as part of my degree.
