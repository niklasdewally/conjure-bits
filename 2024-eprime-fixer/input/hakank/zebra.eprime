$ WHO OWNS THE ZEBRA?
$ 
$ This is a puzzle which has been circulating the net. There are a couple
$ different versions out there which try to be a little more politically
$ correct but are essentially the same problem.    
$ 	1. There are five houses, each of a different color and inhabited by
$	   men of different nationalities, with different pets, drinks,
$	   and cigarettes.
$ 	2. The Englishman lives in the red house.
$ 	3. The Spaniard owns the dog.
$ 	4. Coffee is drunk in the green house.
$ 	5. The Ukrainian drinks tea.
$ 	6. The green house is immediately to the right of the ivory house.
$ 	7. The Old Gold smoker owns snails.
$ 	8. Kools are smoked in the yellow house.
$ 	9. Milk is drunk in the middle house.
$ 	10. The Norwegian lives in the first house on the left.
$ 	11. The man who smokes Chesterfields lives in the house next to the
$	    man with the fox.
$ 	12. Kools are smoked in the house next to the house where the horse is
$	    kept.
$ 	13. The Lucky Strike smoker drinks orange juice.
$ 	14. The Japanese smoke Parliaments.
$ 	15. The Norwegian lives next to the blue house.
$ NOW, who drinks water? And who owns the zebra?
