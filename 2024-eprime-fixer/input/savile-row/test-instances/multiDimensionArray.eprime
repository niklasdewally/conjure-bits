language ESSENCE' 1.0

$ create a high-dimensional array and set a variable in it.

find m : matrix indexed by [int(1..3), int(2..4), int(-6..-4), int(2..4), int(1..3), int(-1..1), int(-2..1)] of int(1..10)

$ some vars to use as indices
find a : int(-3..5)
find b : int(0..3)
find c : int(-1..5)
find d : int(1..9)

such that

m[a,4,-6,b,c,-1,d]=5
