given n : int(..)
given num_entries : int(..)
given values : matrix indexed by [int(1..num_entries)] of int(1..100)
given weights : matrix indexed by [int(1..num_entries)] of int(1..100)
find x : matrix indexed by [int(1..num_entries)] of bool
find z : int(0..10000)
maximising z
such that
(z=(sum i : int(1..num_entries) . (x[i] * values[i]))),
(((sum i : int(1..num_entries) . (x[i] * weights[i])))<=n)
