letting n be 4
letting m be 40
letting range be domain int(1..n)
find weights : matrix indexed by [range] of int(1..m)
find x : matrix indexed by [int(1..m),range] of int((-1)..1)
such that
(forAll i : int(2..n) . (weights[(i - 1)]<=weights[i])),
(sum(weights)=m),
(forAll j : int(1..m) . (((sum i : range . (x[j, i] * weights[i])))=j))
