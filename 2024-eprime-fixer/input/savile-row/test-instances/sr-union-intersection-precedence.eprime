$ check union and intersection -- intersection evaluated first.
$ should be {3..5,6}  
$ left-to right would be {6}
$ union first would be {6}

find x : int(1..9) intersect int(3..5) union int(2,6) intersect int(1,6)

$ check union and setdifference -- should be same precedence.
$ should be left-first {2,7,8,9}
$ if union were higher, {7,8,9}
$ if setminus were higher, 1,2,6,7,8,9
find y : int(1..9) - int(3..5) union int(2,6) - int(1,6)

such that
    forall i : int(3..5) union int(7..9) .( x < y /\ y+i > x )
